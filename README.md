# Event Services Website
A website built with essentially only HTML, CSS, and a touch of Bootstrap. It was designed to be very lightweight and function perfectly on screens of any resolution (including mobile) without any wrappers.

You can view (a PHP-less version of) this website on [my GitHub pages](https://nwam.github.io/event_services_website/).
